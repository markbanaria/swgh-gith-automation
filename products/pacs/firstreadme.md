# CSharp (C#) Client

A sample client implementation of the pet adoption workflow in csharp.

> This example will demonstrate making requests to the specified operations (`getPets`, `postAdoption`, etc.) with appropriate handling of inputs and outputs. We'll serialize and deserialize JSON manually using `System.Text.Json`, which is included in the `.NET Core` and `.NET 5+` frameworks.
